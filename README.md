## Problem Statement
Insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of health insurance for individuals to set premiums appropriately. However, traditional methods of cost prediction often rely on broad actuarial tables and historical averages, which may not account for the nuanced differences among individuals. By leveraging machine learning techniques, insurers can predict more
accurately the insurance costs tailored to individual profiles, leading to more competitive pricing and better risk management.

## Project Need
● Enhance Precision in Pricing 
● Increase Competitiveness
● Improve Customer Satisfaction
● Enable Personalized Offerings
● Risk Assessment
● Policy Development
● Strategic Decision Making
● Customer Engagement
